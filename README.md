# How To Play

You roll your die by clicking and holding the left mouse button. The longer you hold the button, the more power goes into your roll. You can also rotateby (W, UP, S, Down) and reposition (A, Left, D, Right) each die before you roll. 

Your score for each roll is equal to the number on the face of the die facing upwards, multiplied by any score multipliers.

If a die falls off of the table, then it is worth 0 points.

# Tips

The dice can bounce off of the rim of the table. Take advantage of this when other dice are in your way.

You can roll your current die into other dice on the board to reposition them. You can use this strategy to flip the face of a die on the table to a higher value, or to push the die onto a score multiplier.

Keep in mind that the die will roll and bounce depending on the power of the roll. Take this into consideration when aiming your roll.
